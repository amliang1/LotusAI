# LotusAI Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: MVP & Core Functionality (Completed on March 2, 2025)

### 1. Environment Initialization
- Created the basic folder structure according to the implementation plan:
  ```
  LotusAI/
    ├── Models/
    ├── Views/
    ├── ViewModels/
    ├── Networking/
    ├── Persistence/
    ├── Utilities/
    └── Resources/
  ```

### 2. Data Models
- Created `ChatMessage.swift` model with:
  - Properties for ID, sender, text, and timestamp
  - Relationship with Chat model
  - Enum for sender types (user, assistant)
- Created `Chat.swift` model with:
  - Properties for ID, title, creation date, and update date
  - Relationship with ChatMessage model
- Fixed circular reference issue between Chat and ChatMessage models

### 3. Networking
- Created `APIClient.swift` with:
  - Singleton pattern for shared instance
  - Placeholder methods for sending messages to AI API
  - Placeholder method for validating API keys
  - Error handling for API interactions

### 4. Security & Utilities
- Created `KeychainManager.swift` with:
  - Methods for securely storing API keys in the Keychain
  - Methods for retrieving and deleting API keys
  - Error handling for Keychain operations

### 5. ViewModels
- Created `ChatViewModel.swift` with:
  - Logic for sending messages and receiving responses
  - Integration with APIClient for network requests
  - Integration with SwiftData for persistence
- Created `OnboardingViewModel.swift` with:
  - Logic for validating and storing API keys
  - Integration with KeychainManager for secure storage

### 6. Views
- Created `OnboardingView.swift` for first-time user setup
- Created chat-related views:
  - `ChatBubbleView.swift` for message display
  - `ChatView.swift` for individual chat conversations
  - `ChatListView.swift` for displaying all chats
- Created `SettingsView.swift` for managing API keys and app settings
- Created `MainTabView.swift` for the main app navigation

### 7. Integration
- Set up relationships between models for SwiftData
- Connected views with view models
- Implemented basic navigation flow
- Updated LotusAIApp.swift to include new models in the schema
- Added conditional rendering based on onboarding status

## Debugging
- Fixed circular reference issue in SwiftData models
- Ensured proper imports in all files

## Phase 2: Advanced Features (In Progress)

### 1. AI Model Configuration System
- Created `AIModelConfig.swift` model with:
  - Properties for name, provider, model, temperature, and max tokens
  - Support for default configuration flag
  - Enum-based provider and model types for structured management
- Implemented providers:
  - OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
  - Anthropic (Claude 3 models)
  - Custom provider option
- Created view model for AI model configurations:
  - Methods for creating, updating, and deleting configurations
  - Default configuration management
  - Provider-specific model filtering

### 2. Prompt Library System
- Created `PromptTemplate.swift` model with:
  - Properties for title, content, and creation/update dates
  - Support for default template flag
- Implemented view model for prompt templates:
  - Methods for creating, updating, and deleting templates
  - Default template management
  - Template organization

### 3. Configuration Views
- Created views for AI model configuration:
  - `AIModelConfigView.swift` for listing and managing configurations
  - `AIModelConfigRow.swift` for displaying individual configurations
  - `NewAIModelConfigView.swift` for adding new configurations
  - `EditAIModelConfigView.swift` for modifying existing configurations
- Created views for prompt library:
  - `PromptLibraryView.swift` for managing prompt templates
  - Support for creating, editing, and deleting templates

### 4. SwiftData Integration
- Updated schema to include new models
- Implemented proper ModelContainer initialization
- Added default configurations and templates
- Fixed ObservableObject conformance for view models

### 5. Technical Improvements
- Refactored view models to use ObservableObject pattern
- Improved error handling and validation
- Enhanced UI with better interaction patterns
- Fixed compilation issues and duplicate declarations

## Next Steps
1. Implement actual API integrations for different providers
2. Create share extension for inline AI commands
3. Add comprehensive error handling and network status monitoring
4. Implement cost estimation for API calls
5. Add unit and UI testing

## Notes
- The current implementation uses placeholder API responses
- API keys are securely stored in the Keychain
- Basic error handling is in place for network and persistence operations
- The app now supports multiple AI models and custom prompt templates
